# DEMONSTRATION AND TESTING OF INTEGRATION OF PHANTOM TOOLS

> PHANTOM technologies enable the development of next generation heterogeneous, parallel and low-power computing systems through innovative tools that hide the complexity of computing hardware from the programme.

## Introduction

Thr purpose of the files here are for provide a description and examples of the integration and interaction between the PHANTOM tools, as well as within the users and instrumented applications.

## Request of Execution of an instrumented Application, and suscription to nitification of its completion

In this folder there are:
* Example in Java of requesting the execution of an APP, and requesting to be notified of the execution. files are in the folder "java_requestor_of_execution" [See the files][java_app]
* Instrumented application in C, the application sends monitoring metrics to the Monitoring Framework, and at its ending the  global statistics to the Execution Manager as a notification of its completion.
The application which is instrumented with additional code for monnitoring, and reporting to the Execution Manager is on the folder "app_to_be_executed". [See the files][pi_app]
* The notification of the completion of an app consists of a JSON file, which is the same as the one send by the application to the Execution Manager whent its ends.

A video of these examples running is available at [https://youtu.be/6s6AOytHV6I][video]

More detailed description is available on the respective folders.
