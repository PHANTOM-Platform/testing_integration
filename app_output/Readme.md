# Example of Uploaded Statistics to the Execution Manager

The data file in this folder, which is in JSON format, is the uploaded statistics into the Execution Manager from a previous execution of the example.

This file is also the same data sent to the suscribers on the completion of the execution.


**Notice:** the format and the data structure will change as the integration of the tools with the uses cases progress.
